# arc_photography_website
I built a photography website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interaction.
I utilised the Bootstrap framework for some elements as well as grid and flex-box.

I spent a lot of time considering the UI and UX, some elements still require improvement: the image description anfter onclick event and the footer.

To improve this further I would like to add a purchase function wo users can buy prints.

I have enjoyed wrking n this project and will continue to update. 

All images were captured by me which made sourcing suitable images very easy.
